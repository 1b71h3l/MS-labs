# Modelling and Simulation (M&S) Labs Solutions
### This repository contains my own solutions for the M&S Labs + the solution of the final test made by Dr. Belkacem KHALDI (b.khaldi@esi-sba.dz) the lecturer of the course Modelling and Simulation at ESI-sba .
#### The course is an introduction of some of the fundamental techniques in M&S and provides an understanding of the systems and tools used in this field.
